# Voxel Game

A free and open-source voxel-based survival game (a.k.a. Minecraft clone), compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Make sure that [OpenTK 4.9.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/4.9.4) is added as dependency (should be added automatically).
   We use OpenTK for OpenGL rendering, window management, and input handling.

That's it, you're ready to go!
